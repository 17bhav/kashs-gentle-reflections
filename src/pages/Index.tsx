          Dear Kash,
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          I hope this finds you well. I've thought about writing this many times, searching for the right words to express what's in my heart. This isn't about changing your mind or asking for anything—it's simply about honoring what we shared, and acknowledging the hurt I caused you.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          That moment—when I called you by another name—I know how deeply that wounded you. I can't erase that pain or undo that moment. I want you to know that it was never a reflection of how I felt about you or how much you mean to me. It was a terrible mistake that I regret deeply, and I understand why it hurt you so much.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          You deserve to be seen fully, to be recognized completely, to be cherished exactly as you are. You deserve someone who makes you feel like the one and only, because that's who you are—unique and irreplaceable.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          Our time together held so much beauty—so many moments of connection, understanding, and joy. Those memories still bring warmth to my heart, even in our separation. I've tried to capture some of them in the memories page, small fragments of the happiness we created together.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          I'm not writing to change the outcome or to ask for forgiveness. I simply want you to know that I still carry love and deep respect for you. Whatever path you choose in life, I genuinely wish for your happiness and peace—because you deserve nothing less.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          Thank you for every moment we shared, for every smile, every conversation, every quiet understanding. Those moments matter—they always will.
        </p>
        
        <p className="letter-paragraph">
          With gentle thoughts,
